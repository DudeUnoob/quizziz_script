Once it's downloaded, open your file explorer/finder

<li>
If you're on mac, <b>Double click on it</b>

</li>
<li>
If you're on windows, <b>Right click on it</b> and then click on <b>Extract all</b>
</li>


Once that's done, you should have a folder titled along the name:

Now the main part. I will be using chrome for this guide but it should work the same for any chromium based browser, etc. or any other browser ig.

Next, go to your chrome extensions page by typing <b>chrome://extensions</b> into the url bar

Once you get that, make sure the <b>Developer mode</b> is turned on

Now click on <b>Load unpacked</b> and select the folder you extracted earlier which was titled alnog the lines <i>quizizz_script-main</i>

Now you're done with the setup!
Go to your quizizz game AND MAKE SURE YOU ARE IN THE GAME or at least one person is in the game

Then, click on the extention, input you're game code and "Start Helper" and it should work!

If you don't see the extention, click on that little puzzle icon and a dropdown should appear, click on <b>Quizizz Helper Icon</b> and it should be there!
